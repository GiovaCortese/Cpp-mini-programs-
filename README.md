# Cpp-randomPwdGen
A C++ program to practice/refresh on the language which takes a single digit as input from the user and outputs a random password of at least 7 characters. 

This simple program takes a single digit as input and randomly generates characters based on their ASCII codes. The first character of every password is a capital letter (ASCII code between and including 65 amd 90) and the rest are any combination of characters consisting of letters (upper and lower case), digits (0-9) and any special characters.
